* Added possibilities to remove from current selection in the student overview for assignment administrator
  in addition to existing functionality for replacing and adding student to current selection. This makes
  it easier to remove student with special tags for example those who have alreade passed the assignment.

* Added an aggregated student info view for Administrators. This will help the managers to be able 
  to easily look up and check for possible wrongly data. Devilry integrates with third-party solutions for the
  raw student data and flaws and erros in the data are not always automatically ruled out.
