Getting started
---------------
We recommend that you start with a quick look at :ref:`commonconcepts`.
This avoids confusion with a few special terms that Devilry uses to allow
it to be used in many different settings. When you have skimmed over the concepts,
you can continue with the other Topic guides below.
