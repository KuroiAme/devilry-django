You can search through your assignments using the search input field in the top right corner.


The courses overview
====================

As you can see, there is a button labeled ``Your courses`` below the list of assignments.
This a overview with nothing more than a list of courses you have access to. Each course link
will take you to a simple assignment overview for that specific course.
