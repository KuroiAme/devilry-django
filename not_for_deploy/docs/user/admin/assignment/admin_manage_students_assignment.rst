.. _organize_project_groups_assignment:

Organize students in project groups
###################################
The `Organize students in project groups`-link gives you the opportunity to change the default organization of
project groups.

.. image:: images/admin-organize-project-groups-link.png

As mentioned in :ref:`defaults_new_assignment` a student is automatically put in a project group when a new assignment
is created. If you want to have larger project groups for the assignment, you can do this on this page.

.. image:: images/admin-organize-project-groups-page.png

As an example we here want to have two students in a project group. We start with selecting April Duck and Dewey Duck
in one project group, and than click the `Create project group` button.

.. image:: images/admin-create-project-group-page.png

If you now go back to the `Manage students` page (back button two times after creating the new group) you'll see there
is a new group with two members. If you now want to undo this action, splitting the group back to two groups with a
single student in each, you click the block element of the group as described in :ref:`student_information_assignment`.
Here you chose the `Split group`-link.

In the next view you chose which student(s) to remove from the group.


.. _manage_deadline_assignment:

Manage deadline
###############
The last meny option in this section is the `Manage deadline`-link.

.. image:: images/admin-manage-deadline-link.png

Here you have the possibility for change the deadline for delivery for all groups or for just some groups. After
choosing which groups that should get an extended deadline, you have to add a comment which says why the chosen groups
get the extension and set the new deadline. When you're good to go, click `Move deadline`.
