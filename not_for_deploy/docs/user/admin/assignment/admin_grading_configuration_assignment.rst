On this view you set how the examiner grades deliveries from a student for an assignment. There are two options:

 - Passed/Failed
 - Points

Further you also decide how the student sees the grading; passed/failed or with the number of points.

.. _passed_failed_grading_assignment:

Passed/Failed
#############
If this option is chosen, you can also give students points awarded for getting a passing grad. This may be useful if
you have 10 assignments in a semester and students need 8 point to qualify for the exam. The assignments in a semester
may reward different points, so a bigger assignment may give 2 points.
