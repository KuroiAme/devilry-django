Creating a new assignment
=========================
Creating a new assignment is a pretty simple process. Clicking the `Create new assignment`-link will take you to the
page where you actually create the assignment.

The create assignment page has a few required fields that's needs to be set before you can create the assignment. Simply
give the assignment a name and a first deadline. You have a lot of options for tweaking the assignment after it has
been created. We'll create a simple assignment called `Assignment 33` with deadline set to November 21, 2018 11:40 am
by using the `Select a date/time`. You can also use one of the suggested deadlines.

Adding students to the new assignment
#####################################

We provide a few shortcuts for adding students to the assignment. You can add all students on the semester,
no students or select an assignment you would like copy students from.

From each of the previous assignments, you have two options:

 - **Copy all students** will copy all students from the selected assignment, and keep the projectgroup and
   examiner setup.
 - **Copy students with passing grade** will copy all students from the selected assignment with a passing grade, and
   keep the projectgroup and examiner setup.
