Creating a new assignment (WORK IN PROGRESS)
============================================
We'll take you through the workflow of creating a new assignment, setting the first deadline, adding students and
examiners, editing and configuration of the assignment.


Creating a new assignment
#########################
Creating a new assignment is a pretty simple process. Clicking the `Create new assignment`-link will take you to the
page where you actually create the assignment.

The create assignment page has a few required fields that's needs to be set before you can create the assignment. Simply
give the assignment a name and a first deadline. You have a lot of options for tweaking the assignment after it has
been created. We'll create a simple assignment called `Assignment 33` with deadline set to November 21, 2018 11:40 am
by using the `Select a date/time`. You can also use one of the suggested deadlines.
