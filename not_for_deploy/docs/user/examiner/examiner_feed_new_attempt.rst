You have corrected the first delivery, and failed it. You're feeling good to day, so you decide to give the
student/students a second attempt at correcting their mistakes from the first delivery. As mentioned above, you can
edit an existing grade, but if the students actually failed, the correct way would be to give them another attempt.
