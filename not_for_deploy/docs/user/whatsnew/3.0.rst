New for administrators
**********************
TODO:

    - New UI. Mostly the same workflow, but more streamlined.
    - Unified admin UI for all administrators. The only difference is that
      higher permission levels gain you a few extra views.
    - New group based permission system.
    - Node is removed - replaced by a tag system.

    Department administrator:

    - Can add new courses.
    - Much shorter path to most common operations.

    Semester within a course:

    - Can add (import) students that does not have a devilry user.
    - Automatically add new students added to the semester to all assignments
      (can be disabled)

    Assigment:

    - No assignment administrator - explain how period admin works.
    - Automatically setup assignments like the previous assignment.
    - Can add (import) students that does not have a devilry user.
    - Can invite students via share URL.
    - Much easier to re-organize students.
    - Assign students to examiners by tags --> copy from another
      assignment + ability to filter on sync system tag. You setup one
      assignment, and use that as a template for other assignments.
      If you have the same setup for the entire semester, new assignments
      will automatically be configured with this setup.
    - Much more streamlined assignment configuration and setup.
    - Huge performance optimizations (show some numbers from Heroku).
    - New anonymizationmode - fully anonymized - for exams.
    - Separation of student and examiner administration pages:
        - Provides a much more user friendly experience when setting
          up students and examiners.
