Students, examiners and admins:

 - Feedback feed: Previously, merge history was excluded if no public comments existed. We now include all types of comments. Note that merged
   feedbackset with "internal" notes will only be visible to examiners and admin, and will not clutter up the feedbackfeed of a student.

 - Feedback feed: Merge history is expanded by default.
