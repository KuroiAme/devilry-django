New for administrators
**********************

- New UI. Mostly the same workflow, but more streamlined.
- Unified admin UI for all administrators. The only difference is that
  higher permission levels gain you a few extra views.
- New group based permission system.
- Node is removed - replaced by a tag system.

Department administrator:
-------------------------

- Can add new courses.
- Much shorter path to most common operations.

Semester within a course:
-------------------------

- Can add (import) students that does not have a devilry user.
- Automatically add new students added to the semester to all assignments
  (can be disabled)

Assigment:
----------

- No assignment administrator - this is changed so that a typical TA can be a semester
  administrator, but not gain access to certain assignments (based on anonymizationmode).
- Automatically setup assignments like the previous assignment.
- Can add (import) students that does not have a devilry user.
- Can invite students via share URL.
- Much easier to re-organize students.
- Assign students to examiners by tags --> copy from another
  assignment + ability to filter on sync system tag. You setup one
  assignment, and use that as a template for other assignments.
  If you have the same setup for the entire semester, new assignments
  will automatically be configured with this setup.
- Much more streamlined assignment configuration and setup.
- Huge performance optimizations (show some numbers from Heroku).
- New anonymizationmode - fully anonymized - for exams.
- Separation of student and examiner administration pages:
    - Provides a much more user friendly experience when setting
      up students and examiners.
